Partial Modification Loader(PML) is a mod/plugin system designed for generic Java application interfacing, utilizing elements of Aspect Oriented Program. (Uses Oracle Java 7 - Dalvik not supported)


This is the Core code for PML - this portion of the code deals with loading, managing, and communicating with mods/plugins; generating and maintaining application hooks; and dealing with obfuscations.

The hooks generated by PML are inspired by scripting languages in general, re-imagined in order to de-clutter developers' code and add support for mod/plugin disabling. Only classes loaded after the application's main class (inclusively) are eligible for hook injection, and additional hooks cannot be added after the target class is loaded. The disabling of mods/plugins does not change the availability of hooks, only their applied usage.
